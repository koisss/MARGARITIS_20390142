rule compare possible fraction first rule addition like quantity added example various quantity quarter unlike quantity adding third quarter must first converted like quantity described imagine pocket containing two quarter another pocket containing three quarter total five quarter since four quarter equivalent one dollar represented follows add fraction containing unlike quantity eg quarter third necessary convert amount like quantity easy work chosen type fraction convert simply multiply together two denominator bottom number fraction case integer number apply invisible denominator 1 adding quarter third type fraction converted twelfth thus consider adding following two quantity first convert 3 5 displaystyle tfrac 35 fifteenth multiplying numerator denominator three 3 5 3 3 9 15 displaystyle tfrac 35times tfrac 33tfrac 915 since 33 equal 1 multiplication 33 change value fraction second convert 23 fifteenth multiplying numerator denominator five 2 3 5 5 10 15 displaystyle tfrac 23times tfrac 55tfrac 1015 seen equivalent method expressed algebraically algebraic method always work thereby guaranteeing sum simple fraction always simple fraction however single denominator contain common factor smaller denominator product used example adding 3 4 displaystyle tfrac 34 5 6 displaystyle tfrac 56 single denominator common factor 2 therefore instead denominator 24 4 6 halved denominator 12 may used reducing denominator result also factor numerator smallest possible denominator given least common multiple single denominator result dividing rote multiple common factor single denominator called least common denominator process subtracting fraction essence adding find common denominator change fraction equivalent fraction chosen common denominator resulting fraction denominator numerator result subtracting numerator original fraction instance subtract mixed number extra one borrowed minuend instance multiply fraction multiply numerator multiply denominator thus explain process consider one third one quarter using example cake three small slice equal size make quarter four quarter make whole twelve small equal slice make whole therefore third quarter twelfth consider numerator first fraction two third twice large one third since one third quarter one twelfth two third quarter two twelfth second fraction three quarter three time large one quarter two third three quarter three time large two third one quarter thus two third time three quarter six twelfth short cut multiplying fraction called cancellation effectively answer reduced lowest term multiplication example two common factor numerator left fraction denominator right divided three common factor left denominator right numerator divided since whole number rewritten divided 1 normal fraction multiplication rule still apply example method work fraction 61 mean six equal part one whole product mixed number computed converting improper fraction27 example alternately mixed number treated sum multiplied binomial example divide fraction whole number may either divide numerator number go evenly numerator multiply denominator number example 10 3 5 displaystyle tfrac 103div 5 equal

3 1 4 2 3 2 3 displaystyle tfrac 12div tfrac 34tfrac 12times tfrac 43tfrac 1cdot 42cdot 3tfrac 23 change common fraction decimal long division decimal representation numerator denominator idiomatically also phrased divide denominator numerator round answer desired accuracy example change 14 decimal divide 100 4 4 100 obtain 025 change 13 decimal divide 1000 3 3 1000 stop desired
